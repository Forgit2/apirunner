# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The API Test Runner is a comprehensive testing framework built in Rust that provides a plugin-based architecture for testing various API protocols. The system supports multiple execution modes (serial, parallel, distributed), data-driven testing, multi-level assertion strategies, and comprehensive reporting capabilities. It aims to provide a flexible, extensible, and high-performance solution for API testing across different environments and use cases.
